# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of this project was to analyze the reading and math scores of students from different perspectives such as by grade level, school, and calculated the budgets. However, due to the possibility that Thomas High School's 9th grade class may have cheated, some of their scores had to be removed and re-analyzed to get a more honest and accurate result.

## Results
### How is the district summary affected?

The school summary on the other hand had a major change in the overall passing percentage. After removing the 9th graders, Thomas High went from a 91% passing rate to a 65% passing rate.

Replacing the 9th graders' math and reading scores really affected Thomas High School. Their performance went from being outstanding,ranked at #2 to dropping all the way to average ranking #8 which is the middle between all the schools. 

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
### Math and reading scores by grade

<img width="425" alt="Average Reading Scores" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104862099/178331493-a5edb2de-235a-4a2d-98d5-0f97c9053f83.png">

By removing the 9th grade scores, their results are filled in by "nan" meaning not a number. Since their scores were falsely elevated, upon removal it made their school overall drop.

### Scores by school spending

After removing the 9th grade Thomas High scores from the spending range, there was not much of a difference in spending scores. The results remained almost identical.

### Scores by school size

2)There was a significant drop in school rankings from being second to being eighth
3)There were differences to almost every score, although some could only be seen in the hundredths and thousandths digits due to being minimal
4)There were results listed as "nan" as a way to remove possibly false scores inputed for Thomas High 9th grade class. Around 500 scores had to be removed.
